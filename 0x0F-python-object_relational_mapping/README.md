15. Improve the files [model_city.py](model_city.py) and [model_state.py](model_state.py), and save them as [relationship_city.py](relationship_city.py) and [relationship_state.py](relationship_state.py):
	* `City` class:
		* No change
	* State class:
		* In addition to previous requirements, the class attribute `cities` must represent a relationship with the class `City`. If the `State` object is deleted, all linked `City` objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a `City` object to his `State` should be named `state`
	* Use the module `SQLAlchemy`
	* Write a script that creates the `State` “California” with the `City` “San Francisco” from the database `hbtn_0e_100_usa`: ([100-relationship_states_cities.py](100-relationship_states_cities.py))
		* Takes 3 arguments: `mysql username`, `mysql password` and `database name`

17. Script that lists all `City` objects from the database `hbtn_0e_101_usa`
